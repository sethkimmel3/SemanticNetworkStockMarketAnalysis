# SemanticNetworkStockMarketAnalysis

The code in this repository was written for ELEC 573 - Network Science & Analytics - at Rice University.

SemanticNetwork.py constructs the semantic stock market network.
sandbox.py performs some preliminary tests on the network.
correlations.py takes the network as well as financial time-series data to draw inferences from the network.
